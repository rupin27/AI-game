# AI-game
Welcome! The program is a modularized code that has been implemented using structures and pointers along with multiple functions in the implementation avoiding the use of global variables. The main octagonal themed game board was implemented using pointers and with the use of malloc to dynamically allocates the requested memory and return a pointer to keep the octagons connected and easy to assign and access its content by pointing to the value that the pointer points at on the grid and print the status of the game.
I have an AI that is programmed to go first using the random method(making sure it starts on a position with value 1) and has been implemented in a way to reach for the highest value and give the player a tough match-up. With a linked game board, I can mark out all the possible positions the AI can move to using pointers and choose the one with the highest value. Printing and calculating the score has been made accessible using the concept of a typedef grid structure holding several variables and pointer variables related to the game.
